<p class="aboutme"> My name is Marlene Sahalon and I am a film and media major. I am also an esthetician. In Web Production 1, I created a website for my business. I had such a fun time implementing my knowledge and designing my own website. Here is the link to see my work from <a href="https://fmundergrad.hunter.cuny.edu/~sahalonm/medp285/Final/index.html"> Web Production 1 </a>

I want to gain more knowledge on new coding languages. I want to be more advanced and excel in more than just HTML and CSS. I'm excited to implement all the new programming languages to design a more dynamic website. </p>
